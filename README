Resume Parser
By MARPATdroid
v0.0.1

This java applet parses through a list of resume bullet points for skills (short blurbs) and experiences (lerger bullet Points)

it compares them against harvested
Needs (must haves from a listing),
Desires (Optionals from a listing),
and
others (other key phrases put in a file from the listing)

Sections for the Resume are formatted as such:
Skills
<Short Lines>
------------    (10 hyphens)

Experience
<Long Lines>

example below

Skills
Lorem Ipsum
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
Duis aute irure dolo
culpa qui officia
dolore magna aliqua
----------

Experience
commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt
veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea



Job postings are represented in a similar manner except with need, desired, and other, Example below:

Need
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
eniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea
sunt in culpa qui officia
vivamus fringilla lacus nec metus bibendum
----------

Desired
e cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.
sunt in culpa qui officia
Tempus leo eu aenean sed diam urna
----------
Other
Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit
sunt in culpa qui officia
malesuada lacinia integer nunc posuere



Place both files in the same area as the compiled JAR
The application will prompt you for the names of the resume, and the job listing separately.
It will also ask you if you want to have the output in color.
If you are in linux color should work out of the box in most linux distros.
In Windows if you want color follow these steps... or just don't want color:

Using the Registry Editor:

    Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
    Navigate to the following key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console.
    If the VirtualTerminalLevel key doesn't exist, create a new DWORD (32-bit) Value named VirtualTerminalLevel.
    Set the value to 1.
    Restart the Command Prompt or open a new one for the changes to take effect


This is a fairly quick and simple analysis that should provide a good starting point
The Output will contain the following sections to help you refine your resume:

Length of words in resume:          Total number of unique words in resume
Length of words in listing:         Total number of unique words in listing
---------------------------------------------
              Skills Section
---------------------------------------------
The number of skill hits for needs, desires, and others based on user set match threshold
a list of each line in skills section of resume with the highest match percent and what section of the listing it came out of will default to needs
eg.
Expertise in legal document preparation || Match 0% of type Needs

If color is on these will be color coded red < 1/3 threshold match; yellow < 2/3 threshold match; Blue < threshold match; green up to 100% match
any matches over the threshold will also have the lines from the job posting that hit as matches to make sure that the match makes sense

---------------------------------------------
              Experience Section
---------------------------------------------

This is exactly teh same as the Skills section above it just covers the experience seciton of your resume

---------------------------------------------
              Words Missing
---------------------------------------------

Gets all of the words in the job posting separates words based on spaces or the following symbols -;,_+&
Also gives you a percent of words that your resume has matched in the job listing.


---------------------------------------------
    lines not addressed in job listing
---------------------------------------------

Based off of the set threshold any lines in the job listing that your resume didn't hit wil lbe listed here broken into sections:
Needs:

Desires:

Others:


___________________________________________________________________________________________
Other notes I recommend using the last two sections to really tighten down and hit all the key points in your resume
I also recommend using any of the blue and green level hits from the first sections to keep in the resume, use some of the yellows to pad it if necessary
and delete all of the reds.   Your resume should be 1 page, maybe 2 pages tops, a hiring manager is going to spend all of 3 minutes looking at your resume.
you need to hit that hard in those 3 minutes.

This tool should help you get through the screener, but if it takes you 3 or 4 pages then you're already done.

I also recommend a threshold of 70-80%
